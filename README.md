## Introduction

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without running into the walls of the game area or into the snake's own body.

## How to Play

1. **Controls**: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.

2. **Objective**: Eat the food that appears on the game board to grow your snake longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or with itself.

3. **Scoring**: Each time the snake eats food, the player's score increases. The longer the snake gets, the higher your score will be.

4. **Game Over**: The game is over when the snake collides with the walls or with itself. Your final score will be displayed, and you can choose to play again.
